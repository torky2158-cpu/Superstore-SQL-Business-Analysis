Regional Performance Overview

Regional performance was evaluated using total sales, total profit, profit margin, customer count, and revenue efficiency indicators.

1️⃣ West Region – Primary Growth Engine

    • Total Sales: 2,104,438.82
    • Total Profit: 269,936.40
    • Profit Margin: 12.83%
    • Customers: 686
    • Avg Revenue per Customer: 3,067.70

West dominates both revenue and profit contribution.
Its large customer base combined with solid margin performance indicates operational strength and strong market penetration.

West is the company’s core revenue and profit driver.

2️⃣ South Region – Margin Optimization Opportunity

    • Total Sales: 138,571.71
    • Total Profit: 10,007.48
    • Profit Margin: 7.22%
    • Customers: 68

South generates moderate revenue but operates at significantly lower margins compared to other regions.

This suggests pricing inefficiencies, higher costs, or aggressive discounting strategies reducing profitability.

3️⃣ East Region – Profitability Efficiency Leader

    • Total Sales: 52,676.75
    • Total Profit: 6,973.48
    • Profit Margin: 13.24% (Highest)
    • Customers: 36

Although East operates at smaller scale, it achieves the highest margin performance.

This indicates strong pricing efficiency and cost control. Expanding customer acquisition in this region could significantly improve overall profitability.

4️⃣ Central Region – Structural Weakness

    • Total Sales: 1,513.48
    • Total Profit: -100.80
    • Profit Margin: -6.66%
    • Customers: 3

Central is not simply underperforming — it is severely underpenetrated.

With only three customers and negative margin, the region lacks sufficient commercial presence to sustain operations.

Immediate strategic review is required:
    • Market expansion investment
    • Operational restructuring
    • Or potential exit strategy
