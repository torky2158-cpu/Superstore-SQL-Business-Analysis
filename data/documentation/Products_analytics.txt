Products Performance Analysis
Profitability & Strategic Product Evaluation

This section evaluates product-level performance to identify profitability drivers, revenue concentration, margin leaders, and underperforming segments requiring corrective action.

Overview

The analysis examines performance across Category and Sub-Category levels using:

    • Total Revenue
    • Total Profit
    • Profit Margin

The portfolio includes a mix of:

    • High-volume revenue drivers
    • High-margin products
    • Loss-generating items

Category-Level Profitability
🟢 Most Profitable Category

Technology

    • Strong overall revenue and profit contribution
    • Driven primarily by Phones, Copiers, and Accessories
    • Represents the core profitability engine of the company

Technology clearly dominates profit generation, indicating heavy reliance on high-value electronic products.

Most Profitable Sub-Category per Category

Furniture: Chairs
    • Highest total profit despite moderate margin

Office Supplies: Binders
    • Strong balance between volume and profitability

Technology: Copiers
    • Highest total profit contribution
    • Strong margin performance

Highest Margin Sub-Categories 🟢

    • Labels
    • Paper
    • Envelopes
    • Copiers

These products generate high profit per sales dollar and represent scalable profitability opportunities.

Loss-Making Sub-Categories 🔴 (Immediate Review Required)

    • Tables (Margin: -0.084)
    • Bookcases (Margin: -0.030)
    • Supplies (Margin: -0.025)

These segments are destroying value and require:

    • Pricing review
    • Cost restructuring
    • Supplier renegotiation
    • Potential discontinuation

⚠ Risk Segment

Machines (Margin: 0.018)

    • Extremely thin profitability buffer
    • Highly sensitive to discounting or cost fluctuations
    • Requires pricing optimization and margin protection strategy

Machines operate close to break-even and expose the company to profit volatility.

Strategic Product Classification

Products were segmented based on comparison against average Units Sold and Average Profit Margin.

Classification Logic

    • Star → High Volume & High Margin
    • Need Optimization → High Volume & Low Margin
    • Premium → Low Volume & High Margin
    • Risk → Low Volume & Low Margin

Need Optimization – High Volume, Low Margin Products

Examples include:

    • Logitech P710e Mobile Speakerphone — Margin: 17.7%
    • KI Adjustable-Height Table — Margin: -5.5%
    • Storex Dura Pro Binders — Margin: 18.1%
    • GBC Transparent Covers — Margin: 6.3%
    • Situations Folding Chairs — Margin: 6.4%

Insight

    • Strong demand but below-average profitability
    • One product generating losses despite high sales volume
    • Margin improvement here can significantly boost overall profit

Revenue Concentration Analysis

To validate category-level insights, product-level revenue concentration was examined.

Top Revenue-Generating Products

    • Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier — 61,599.83
    • Fellowes PB500 Binding Machine — 27,453.38
    • Cisco TelePresence System EX90 — 22,638.48

Insight

Revenue concentration is evident. The top product significantly outperforms others, confirming dependency on high-value Technology products.

Lowest Revenue-Generating Products

    • Eureka Disposable Bags — 1.62
    • Avery 5 — 5.76
    • Xerox 20 — 6.48

Insight

These products contribute negligible revenue and should be evaluated for operational efficiency and inventory justification.

Overall Strategic Interpretation

The company’s profitability is heavily dependent on Technology, particularly Copiers and Phones.

While several sub-categories demonstrate strong margin performance, Furniture contains structural loss segments requiring correction.

Revenue concentration around a limited number of high-value products increases performance sensitivity to demand fluctuations.

Key Recommendations

    • Expand investment in high-margin segments (Copiers, Paper, Labels)
    • Optimize pricing strategy for volume-driven products (Chairs, Phones)
    • Immediately address loss-making items (Tables, Bookcases)
    • Protect thin-margin segments (Machines) from aggressive discounting
    • Reassess low-revenue products for potential discontinuation
