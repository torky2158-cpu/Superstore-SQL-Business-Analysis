Orders Time & Shipping Analysis Report

This analysis evaluates order growth over time and shipping performance efficiency across the dataset.

Order Volume Trend (2014–2017)

Order volume shows consistent year-over-year growth:

2014: 969 orders

2015: 1,038 orders

2016: 1,315 orders

2017: 1,687 orders

There is a clear upward trend in total orders, with significant acceleration after 2015.
Between 2014 and 2017, order volume increased by nearly 74%, indicating strong business expansion and higher operational pressure over time.

Shipping Time Distribution

Shipping duration analysis reveals the following concentration:

2,303 orders were delivered in 3 days

1,084 orders in 4 days

596 orders in 5 days

309 orders in 7 days

The majority of orders (3–4 days) suggest stable and consistent shipping performance.
However, a smaller segment (5–7 days) indicates potential delays or lower efficiency in certain cases.

Overall, shipping operations appear structured around a 3–4 day delivery window, with limited extreme delays.

Extreme Delays (Slowest Orders)

The five slowest orders recorded a shipping duration of 7 days:

CA-2014-100363

CA-2014-103807

CA-2014-104976

CA-2014-105270

CA-2014-105872

These cases represent the maximum observed delay in the dataset.
While 7 days is not critically high, it stands above the dominant 3–4 day delivery window and may indicate operational inefficiencies in specific scenarios.

Fastest Orders (Same-Day Shipping)

The five fastest orders were delivered in 0 days, meaning same-day shipping:

CA-2014-105249

CA-2014-105984

CA-2014-106719

CA-2014-108903

CA-2014-110639

Same-day deliveries demonstrate the system’s ability to process and dispatch orders immediately under certain conditions.
Although not the majority, these cases reflect high operational capability when required.

Shipping Performance by Ship Mode

Shipping time varies clearly across delivery methods:

Same Day → Avg: 0 days | 264 orders

First Class → Avg: 2 days | 787 orders

Second Class → Avg: 3 days | 964 orders

Standard Class → Avg: 5 days | 2,994 orders

Standard Class represents the majority of shipments (~60%+ of total orders), making it the backbone of operations.
Faster modes (Same Day & First Class) serve a smaller but strategically important segment.

Shipping Time Stability (Min–Max Analysis)

Evaluating consistency across shipping modes:

Same Day: 0–1 days (Avg: 0)

First Class: 1–4 days (Avg: 2)

Second Class: 1–5 days (Avg: 3)

Standard Class: 3–7 days (Avg: 5)

The shipping structure appears clearly tiered and logically distributed.
Each mode operates within an expected delivery range, with no extreme outliers beyond 7 days.

Standard Class shows the widest range (3–7 days), which is expected given its high volume. However, variability here has the greatest operational impact due to its dominance in total orders.

Monthly Workload Pressure Analysis

The overall monthly average across the dataset is 104 orders per month.
Based on deviation from this average, months were classified into three categories:

Normal → Below average

Compressed → Around or slightly above average

Very Compressed → 20%+ above average

Key Observations:

A recurring seasonal spike appears consistently in September, November, and December across multiple years.

The highest pressure period occurred in November 2017 (261 orders) — more than double the early 2014 monthly levels.

From 2016 onward, compressed months became more frequent, indicating rising operational strain.

2017 shows the most intense and sustained workload, with multiple consecutive high-pressure months.

This pattern strongly suggests seasonal demand concentration toward the end of each year, likely requiring operational scaling during Q4.

Executive Summary

Between 2014 and 2017, the business experienced significant growth in order volume, increasing by approximately 74%.

Shipping performance is generally stable, with the majority of deliveries completed within 3–4 days. Standard Class dominates total shipments and therefore carries the greatest operational impact.

Seasonal pressure is clearly concentrated in Q4 (September–December), with peak intensity observed in 2017.

Overall, the logistics structure appears well-tiered and consistent, but high-volume months — especially in Q4 — require careful capacity planning to maintain delivery efficiency.
